For California's Golden State Warriors, the 2016 season was another resounding success. After breaking a forty-year championship drought in 2014-2015, the team won their second of three NBA titles in four years.

Many argue that this is in no part, due to the work of the Golden Warrior's five captains: Andre Iguodala, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Kevin Durant. All five players are strong shooters; and all maintained a 40% + success rate for all shots made during the season. However, there is significant variation in the players' shooting styles, which begs the question: has this played to the Warriors' advantage?

To explain the Warrior's resounding success, this article will analyse the shooting patterns of the GSW captains. First we will describe the players' historical playing styles. Then, using 2016/17 season data, we will analyse the location, frequency and success rate of each player's throws to determine if the season represented a deviation from trend.

### About the players

#### Kevin Durant

Durant, a small forward, is known for his flexible playing style and unstoppable offense. He is extremely agile for a player of his size, and because of his height he is a formidable shooter, succeeding 40% of throws from the field.

#### Klay Thompson

|----------------|----------------|
| Age            | 29             |

| With GSW since | 2011           |

Thompson, a shooting guard, is known for his efficient and predictable playing style. Historically, the vast majority of Thompson's shots have been from afar. Across his career he has shot almost as many three-pointers as he has shots within 0-16 feet out of the basket. About 90% of his three-pointers have been assisted by teammates. Also, he has the highest-point to touch ratio of any player on the GSWs.

#### Andre Iguodala

Iguodala is amongst the team's most versatile players, both quick enough to play as a SG, and strong enough to succeed as a SF. As a defender, he is great at forcing turnovers, thanks to his quick reflexes, experience, and excellent propriocepion.

#### Draymond Green

Green's defense allows the Warrior's to play their aggressive, three-pointer offense. He is known for his 'game intelligence', stamina, and energy, and communcation and leadership - both on and off the field.

#### Stephen Curry

Curry, often labeled one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history, is credited with bringing the three-point playing style to the league. He is known both for his techinical skill in shooting, and immense shooting range.

### The Data

#### Location

![Season Shot Charts: All Captains](C:\Users\RD\Documents\R\hw.stat133\workout1\images\gsw.shot.charts.png)

The team's point data reaffirms much of what we know about the player's shooting styles. This faceted shot chart describes the location of every attempted shot by the five players during the 2016-17 season. Each point is colored to represent if the shot was successful.

We see that Iguodala - the versatile defender - makes the least shots of the five players. When he does, he favors the three-point line with moderate success. Otherwise, most of his shots are close to the basket. He also tends to favor the left and right hand sides of the three-point line. Green likewise favors the one-point line, but he tends not to veer towards the left and right hand sides. His remaining shots are closely concentrated around the basket.

Durant and Thompson's shots, by contrast, are vastly more prolific and dispersed. Both players shoot from within and outside the three-point line with, remarkably, equal probabilities of success. Curry, in constrast, favors the three-point line, with a greater-than-even odds of success - a marker of his iconic playing style.

#### Success Rates

##### 2PT Goals

| Player         |  Total|  Made|  Percentage|
|:---------------|------:|-----:|-----------:|
| Andre Iguodala |    210|   134|    63.80952|
| Kevin Durant   |    643|   390|    60.65319|
| Stephen Curry  |    563|   304|    53.99645|
| Klay Thompson  |    640|   329|    51.40625|
| Draymond Green |    346|   171|    49.42197|

Iguodala is the team's most productive two-pointer, succeeding in 64% of all attempts. However, he contributed the least number of shots over the season, at just 194. By contrast, Durant shot the most (390) successful 3-pointers across the season. Thompson and Curry contributed 304 and 329 goals respectively, but were less productive, succeeding in 42% and 40% of attempts respectively.

##### 3PT Goals

| Player         |  Total|  Made|  Percentage|
|:---------------|------:|-----:|-----------:|
| Klay Thompson  |    580|   246|    42.41379|
| Stephen Curry  |    687|   280|    40.75691|
| Kevin Durant   |    272|   105|    38.60294|
| Andre Iguodala |    161|    58|    36.02484|
| Draymond Green |    232|    74|    31.89655|

As expected, Thompson was the team's most productive three-pointer, succeeding in 42% of all attempts. Curry shot an astounding 280 3-point goals across the season. Durant, notably, also shot 105 3-pointers across the season (succeeding in 38% of attempts). Iguodala and Green trailed behind.

##### Summary - All Goals

| Player         |  Total|  Made|  Percentage|
|:---------------|------:|-----:|-----------:|
| Kevin Durant   |    915|   495|    54.09836|
| Andre Iguodala |    371|   192|    51.75202|
| Klay Thompson  |   1220|   575|    47.13115|
| Stephen Curry  |   1250|   584|    46.72000|
| Draymond Green |    578|   245|    42.38754|

Durant, in relative terms, is the team's most productive shooter overall, succeeding in 54% of all of his attempted shots. Curry is the team's most prolific shooter, in terms of both attempted and successful shots. Thompson trails shortly behind. Notably, Iguodala makes the least shots overall (371 compared to Curry's 1250), but is highly productive - succeeding in 52% of his attempts.

### Concluding Remarks

When we look at 2016/17 Warriors' data, it becomes evident that the season was not an aberration of the trend. The Warrior's formidable offense, and line-up of equally-skilled and versatile players underpinned their success in 2016/17, and will continue to do so in the future.
